Following the successful first GenAI4Health workshop at NeurIPS 2024 (https://genai4health.github.io/), generative AI in healthcare has rapidly evolved from exploratory studies to real-world deployments. With increasing FDA involvement and expanding global regulatory frameworks, the second GenAI4Health workshop aims to bring together AI4Health practitioners, safety researchers, and policy experts to address critical challenges in developing robust and policy-compliant GenAI technologies for health.

Generative AI has shown tremendous potential in revolutionizing healthcare delivery, from clinical diagnosis support and personalized treatment planning to synthetic biomedical data generation and AI-assisted surgical robotics. However, as these technologies move from research prototypes to clinical deployment, ensuring trustworthiness, safety, and regulatory compliance becomes paramount. This workshop provides a unique platform for interdisciplinary collaboration among AI researchers, healthcare professionals, policy makers, and regulatory experts to shape the future of responsible GenAI deployment in healthcare.

TOPICS OF INTEREST

For the second GenAI4Health workshop at NeurIPS 2025, we invite submissions of original, unpublished work related to the use of Generative AI in healthcare. Submissions may include, but are not limited to, the following three major topic areas:

Topic 1: GenAI Applications and Use Cases in Health
We welcome submissions showcasing practical, innovative, and emerging applications of GenAI across the healthcare spectrum. Example areas include:
- Clinical diagnosis support systems
- Personalized treatment planning and recommendation
- Synthetic biomedical data generation
- AI-assisted surgical robotics and medical imaging
- Drug discovery and development

Topic 2: Trustworthiness and Risk Management
Approaches to ensuring the safety, robustness, and fairness of GenAI in medical contexts. Topics include:
- Safety benchmarks and evaluation metrics
- Explainability and transparency in medical AI
- Robustness testing for clinical environments
- Privacy-preserving techniques for medical data
- Fairness and equity considerations in healthcare AI

Topic 3: Policy, Regulation, and Compliance
Analysis of regulatory frameworks and real-world deployment challenges. Topics include:
- FDA alignment and approval processes for AI medical devices
- HIPAA and data privacy compliance strategies
- Clinical validation and evidence generation
- Post-market surveillance and safety monitoring
- Ethical guidelines and professional standards

SUBMISSION TRACKS

Submissions within each track can fall into any of the above three topic areas. We provide three tracks for submissions:

Track 1: Research Papers
Form the core of the program and present methodological advances and empirical evaluations. The main content of the paper should be no longer than 9 pages.

Track 2: Demonstration Papers
Showcasing working systems or applications. Present practical implementations and real-world applications. The main content of the paper should be no longer than 5 pages. The paper title should start with 'Demo:'.

Track 3: Position Papers
Offering perspectives or proposals on policy, governance, or deployment strategies. Provide insights on policy frameworks and deployment challenges. See NeurIPS 2025 Call for Position Papers (https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForPositionPapers) for more details. The main content of the paper should be no longer than 5 pages. The paper title should start with 'Position:'.
